# Theatre Ticket Management System

## Overview

This Java project is a ticket management system designed and implemented for the New Theatre company. The system allows users to buy tickets, cancel tickets, view available seats, save and load ticket data to/from a file, and perform other related operations.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following main components:

- `Theatre.java`: Contains the main program logic including functions for buying tickets, canceling tickets, printing seating area, listing available seats, saving/loading ticket data, and more.
- `Ticket.java`: Defines the Ticket class with attributes for row, seat, price, and a Person object. Provides methods to access ticket details and print ticket information.
- `Person.java`: Defines the Person class with attributes for name, surname, and email. Provides methods to access person details.

## Features

- **Main Program Functions**: Implements functions to buy tickets, cancel tickets, print seating area, list available seats, save/load ticket data, print ticket information and total price, and sort tickets by price.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that user inputs are validated to prevent errors and ensure data integrity.
- **Ticket Management**: Manages ticket data using arrays and ArrayList to store ticket information.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Utilizes classes and objects to represent entities such as Person and Ticket, promoting code organization and reusability.

## How to Run the Program

1. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the project repository.
3. Open the project in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Netbeans.
4. Compile and run the `Theatre.java` file to start the program.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the menu options and perform various operations.

## Future Improvements

- Enhance user interface with graphical components for a more user-friendly experience.
- Implement additional features such as seat selection, ticket price calculation based on seat location, etc.
- Improve error handling and input validation to handle edge cases more gracefully.

## Credits

This project was developed as coursework for the "Software Development II" module under the guidance of Dr. Ester Bonmati at the University of Westminster.
